            <h2>SAMS-tagram 3000 [50 points]</h2>
            <p>
                For this assignment, don't change the way that SAMS-tagram looks at all.
                All you'll be doing is adding Firestore connectivity so that
                all of the data storage is persistent. Specifically,
                when a user logs out and logs back in, they should see all of
                the changes that were previously made on the homepage and the
                profile page.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Extra Credit (optional)</h2>
            <p>
                For extra credit, choose one of the websites we created and improve it in some way. To do so, you may edit the CSS, the HTML, or the Javascript. You'll be given points based solely on how complex your improvement is.
            </p>
