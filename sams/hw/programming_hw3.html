            <p>
                <b>The Goal</b> of this assignment is to get even more practice in Javascript
                DOM Manipulation and HTML Forms. Additionally, you'll be creating
                a portfolio website and deploying it to Github Pages so that
                everybody on the internet can see it!<br>
            </p>

            <h2>TODO List [35 points]</h2>
            <p>
                Create a TODO List Application using
                <a href="../notes/todo_list_lab.html">this guide.</a><br>
                NOTE: In the guide, it says to download a starter folder -- you
                don't have to do that. You can simply start from the starter
                folder provided to you in this assignment.
                <br>
                <i>Recommended Due Date: Tuesday, July 16th</i>

            <h2>SAMS-tagram 2.0 [35 points]</h2>
            <p>
                Your goal is to write the necessary Javascript to make this website work.
                You'll be graded on accuracy, or how similar your submission is to this video.

            <h2>Portfolio Website + Deployment [30 points]</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this problem is to get some practice
                designing your own site (with the added bonus of creating
                your own website and deploying it to the internet).
                <br>
                <br>
                Your website must contain the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>an "about" page</li>
                    <li>a "projects" page, with links and descriptions to each of the projects
                    you've built in this class</li>
                </ol>
                Besides that, you have <u>complete freedom</u>. You can make it look
                however you want, and you can even add more pages and content.<br><br>

                Lastly, 10 of these 30 points will be dedicated to deploying the website
                to Github pages. We will walk through how to do this on Thursday.
            </p>

            <h2>Extra Credit (optional)</h2>
            <p>
                For extra credit, choose one of the websites we created and improve it in some way. To do so, you may edit the CSS, the HTML, or the Javascript. You'll be given points based solely on how complex your improvement is.
            </p>

            <p>
