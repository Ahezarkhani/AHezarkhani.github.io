            <h1>Introduction to Javascript!</h1>
            <p>In this activity, you'll start coding in Javascript! To do so, we'll be using a website called Code Academy! Code Academy has a bunch of courses, but we'll be using the "Introduction to Javascript" course, found here: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript</a>. To access the course, you'll need to log in, but you can use a Google Account -- please use your CMU Google account to log in.</p>
            <p>Once you're logged in, you'll see a Syllabus broken up into sections. Today, we'll only be doing some of the "Learn Javascript: Introduction" section. In that section, you'll only be responsible for the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Introduction to Javascript [Interactive Lession]</li>
                <li>Variables [Interactive Lession]</li>
                <li>Introduction to Javascript [Multiple Choice Quiz]</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>You'll begin in class and complete as much as you can, but this will be due by 8:30AM on Tuesday, July 9th. We will be checking for completion at the beginning of class on Tuesday and the grade will count as 20% of Homework 2.</p>
