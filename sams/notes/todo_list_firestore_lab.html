            <h2>Step 0: Understanding Cloud Firestore</h2>
            <div class="notes-container">
                <h3>What is a database and why do we need one?</h3>
                <p>
                    Right now, we have a todo-list app that works -- we can add
                    items and we can even remove them! However, if you ever have
                    to close your browser or reload the page, you'll lose
                    everything on your list! Databases can fix that!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topic we're discussing is called "Persistent State."
                    Basically, data can either be persistent or not. Right now,
                    our data is NOT persistent because it does not live on after
                    our page reloads. We want to make our data persistent and to
                    do so, we need to store it in a database which will save
                    your data between sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what is a database? Well the name kind of speaks for
                    itself: A database is a structured set of data held in a
                    computer <i>OR</i> a place to store data!
                </p>

                <br>
                <h3>How is data stored and stuctured in Cloud Firestore?</h3>
                <p>
                    So how do these things work? Right now, we know that
                    variables store information -- is that the same thing? Nope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Databases store data in a structured way. For Firestore,
                    the data is structured into <i>Collections</i> and
                    <i>Documents.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A document is a single unit of storage. So
                    if you wanted to store information about a user -- like
                    a username, a First and Last name, and a password -- you'd
                    store all of that info in a single document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A collection is just a list of documents. So we could have
                    a collection called "Users" inside of which we store all our
                    documents that have specific data for each user.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h3>So how will we structure our data?</h3>
                <p>
                    For our app, we have Notes and our notes have text associated
                    with them. As such, we'll have a collection called "Notes."
                    Inside of that, we'll create a single document for every
                    sticky-note where we'll save the text associated with the
                    sticky-note.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h3>How do you SAVE data to a Cloud Firestore Database?</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's use our "User" example for this. So we want to add a
                    user -- here's the Javascript code that would do it.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">db.collection("users").add({
    username: "arman22",
    firstname: "Arman",
    lastname: "Hezarkhani",
    password: "armanrocks",
})
.then(function(docRef) {
    console.log("You created a document! Here's its unique ID: ", docRef.id);
})</code></pre>

                <p>
                    That's it! What just happened?<br>
                    On the first line, we're declaring that we want to create
                    a new document inside of the "users" collection.<br>
                    On lines 2-5, we're declaring the values that should be
                    saved inside of this new document. <br>
                    On line 7, we have a <code class="language-js">.then()</code>
                    statement. What's that? Let's take a step back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lines 1-6 are saving data to our Firestore database. To do
                    that, we're literally sending that data over the internet to
                    our database, then our database has to go through the
                    trouble of saving it, all of which takes time. As such,
                    we have a <code class="language-js">.then()</code> statement
                    to say the following: <i>First, I want to store this data
                    to our database. THEN, once it's done, I want to run this
                    function.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what's line 7 doing? It's telling our code what to do
                    after the database is done saving our data!
                    On line 8, we're simply printing out what the database
                    returned to us, which is an ID for this document.<br>
                    Hint, Hint: It's a unique ID, JUST for this document.
                    We'll be using that later on!
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>How do you READ data from a Cloud Firestore Database?</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine we've saved a bunch of users. Now, we want to get
                    every user and simply log the first and last names to the
                    console.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">db.collection("users").get().then((querySnapshot) => {
    querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
        console.log("First Name: " + doc.data().firstname);
        console.log("Last Name: " + doc.data().lastname);
    });
});</code></pre>
            <p>
                This is also a bunch of new stuff -- so what's going on?<br>
                On line 1, we're saying: <i>Hey Database, in that collection
                called "users," get me every value and save that data inside of
                'querySnapshot.'</i>You don't have to know exactly what
                'querySnapshot' is or means -- just know that it has the values
                that we asked our database for.<br>
                On line 2, we're basically saying: <i>Thanks for
                sending me every doc I asked for. Now, for each document
                that you sent me in querySnapshot, I'm going to do some stuff.</i><br>
                Lines 3 and 4 are just logging specific information from each
                document.
            </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    I emailed you with a free cloud credit. Click on
                    "Student Coupon Retrieval Link" and fill out the form. It'll
                    then ask you to verify your email. Once you do, you'll
                    receive another email with a Coupon, looking something like
                    "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX." That coupon holds $50 of free Google
                    Cloud Credit.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h3>2) Redeem the Credits</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/edu">console.cloud.google.com/edu</a>.</li>
                        <li>MAKE SURE YOU'RE LOGGED IN TO YOUR @GMAIL.COM ADDRESS -- NOT YOUR @ANDREW.CMU.EDU ADDRESS</li>
                        <li>Input the code</li>
                        <li>Press "Accept and Continue."</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>3) Open your Firestore Project</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go to <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">console.firebase.google.com</a>.</li>
                        <li>Click on "Create a Project"</li>

                    </ol>
                </p>


                <h3>4) "Add Firestore to your Webapp"</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you've done this, you should be on the Firebase
                    "Getting Started" homepage. On there, you should see four
                    icons -- click on the third one, which looks like HTML code,
                    indicating a "Web" project.<br>
                    This'll open up a new page to "Add Firestore to your Webapp."
                    Under Register App, put "todo_list" for the app nickname and
                    click "Register App."<br>
                    Now, you'll see something like this: <pre><code class="language-js">  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "",
    databaseURL: "",
    projectId: "",

    appId: ""
  };
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);</code></pre>
                    Copy that somewhere (in an empty file somewhere), as we'll
                    need it in a moment.<br>
                    Click "Continue to Console."
                </p>



                <h3>5) Create a Database</h3>

                        <li>On the left navbar, click on "Database."</li>
                        <li>Click "Create Database"</li>
                        <li>In the pop-up, choose "Start in test mode" and click "Next"</li>
                        <li>Leave the default location and click "Done"</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    AAAAAAAND that's all the set-up you need to do!!! Let's recap:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, you got your free Google Cloud credits</li>
                        <li>Then, you input the credit into the cloud console
                        and redeemed $50</li>
                        <li>After that, you opened a project in Firebase and initialized an "App"</li>
                        <li>Lastly, you initialized a database</li>
                    </ul>
                    Wooooo -- now let's code!!!
                </p>
            </div>




<br>
<br>
<br>
            <h2>Step 2: Save Items to the Database</h2>
            <div class="notes-container">
                <p>
                    Now that we have our database set up, let's code!<br>
                    Start by downloading the starter-code here <a href="TODO_2_starter.zip">here</a><br>
                    Right now, the javascript simply runs some code when a form is submitted.<br>
                    Let's add to that!
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, we'll need to add some configuration code -- this is
                    basically code that's required by Firestore in order for
                    the code to work.<br>
                    At the top of the <code>index.js</code>, add the following
                    code:<pre><code class="language-js">firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "",
    databaseURL: "",
    projectId: "",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "",
    appId: ""
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

var db = firebase.firestore();</code></pre>
                    Look familiar? Good! Make sure that <code class="language-js">firebaseConfig</code>
                    has the values that you copied from earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we have the configuration, let's outline what we'll
                    be doing in this code, every time our user submits a new
                    Todo item:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Get the user input</li>
                        <li>Save that input to the database</li>
                        <li>Add the sticky-note to the page</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the previous lab, we did steps 1 and 3. Now, though, we'll
                    be saving to the database before we add a sticky-note
                    to the page.<br>
                    Add some code to read the user's input and pass it to a
                    function called <code class="language-js">saveItemToDatabase</code>.<br>
                    That should look something like this:<pre><code class="language-js">$("#form1").submit(function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  var todo_input = document.getElementById("todo-input");
  var todo_text = todo_input.value;

  saveItemToDatabase(todo_text);

  todo_input.value = "";
});

function saveItemToDatabase(todo_text){
  // Your Code Here!
}</code></pre>
                    So now, every time a user types a todo item, we pass the user's
                    input -- the todo_text -- to a function. In that function,
                    we want to save the todo_text to our firestore database.<br>
                    Try it on your own!<br><br>
                    Your code should now look something like this:<pre><code class="language-js">function saveItemToDatabase(todo_text){
  // Save element to database
  doc = db.collection("notes").add({
    noteText: todo_text
  })
}</code></pre>
                    So...what is this code doing? It's creating a Firestore Document
                    with one element -- <code class="language-js">noteText</code> -- and it's adding that
                    Document to the Collection called <code class="language-js">"notes"</code>.<br>
                    Wanna see if it worked? Check back in the Firestore console to see for yourself!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, now we're saving elements to our database, so we're
                    done with steps 1 and 2. Step 3 is to add our element to
                    a page -- lets add a <code class="language-js">.then()</code>
                    statement to do that now!<br>
                    After doing so, your code should look something like this:<pre><code class="language-js">function saveItemToDatabase(todo_text){
  // Save element to database
  doc = db.collection("notes").add({
    noteText: todo_text
  })
  .then(function(docRef){
    docRef.get().then(function(doc) {
      addNewItem(doc);
    });
  });
}

function addNewItem(doc){
  // Create new todo div to store all todo content
  var todo_card = document.createElement("div");
  todo_card.classList.add("todo_card");

  // Put the todo item in a p
  var todo_text_elem = document.createElement("p");
  todo_text_elem.innerHTML = doc.data().noteText;

  // Construct the entire element
  todo_card.appendChild(todo_text_elem)

  // Add it to the DOM
  document.getElementById("container").appendChild(todo_card);
}</code></pre>
                    Now, every time a user submits a todo item, we're saving the
                    text to the database. When that save is complete, we're passing
                    the document object that the database returns to our
                    <code class="language-js">addNewItem</code> function to add
                    the text to the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, let's write some code to delete the sticky-notes!<br>
                    First, we'll need to give the sticky-notes a unique ID.
                    Luckily, Firebase automatically generates a unique ID for
                    every document you create, and it's stored inside of
                    <code class="language-js">doc.id</code>. <br>
                    So, the following code should allow us to give our sticky note
                    a unique ID:<pre><code class="language-js">var todo_card_id = doc.id
todo_card.id = todo_card_id</code></pre>
                    Lastly, we can add the following code to remove the element
                    from the page AND delete it from the database:<pre><code class="language-js">// Add a click listener to the todo card
todo_card.addEventListener("click", function(){
  // Remove Element from the DOM
  document.getElementById(todo_card_id).remove()
  // Delete from Database
  db.collection("notes").doc(doc.id).delete();
});</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yay!!! Now, we can delete items, too!<br>
                    There's an issue, though... Try refreshing the page :(<br>
                    This is happening because we're not loading elements from
                    the database when we first load the page.

                    If you add the following code to the bottom of the javascript document,
                    that'll work, too:<pre><code class="language-js">function loadNotes(){
  db.collection("notes").get().then(function(querySnapshot) {
    querySnapshot.forEach(function(doc) {
        addNewItem(doc);
    });
  });
};

$(document).ready(function(){
  loadNotes()
});</code></pre>
                </p>
            </div>
